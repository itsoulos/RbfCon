encourage authors to use the following style of structured abstracts,
but without headings: (1) Background: place the question addressed
in a broad context and highlight the purpose of the study; (2) Methods:
describe briefly the main methods or treatments applied; (3) Results:
summarize the article's main findings; (4) Conclusions: indicate the
main conclusions or interpretations. The abstract should be an objective
representation of the article, it must not contain results which are
not presented and substantiated in the main text and should not exaggerate
the main conclusions.}

% For posting an early version of this manuscript as a preprint, you may use "preprints" as the journal and change "submit" to "accept". The document class line would be, e.g., \documentclass[preprints,article,accept,moreauthors,pdftex]{mdpi}. This is especially recommended for submission to arXiv, where line numbers should be removed before posting. For preprints.org, the editorial staff will make this change immediately prior to posting.

\section{How to Use this Template}

The template details the sections that can be used in a manuscript.
Note that the order and names of article sections may differ from
the requirements of the journal (e.g., the positioning of the Materials
and Methods section). Please check the instructions on the authors'
page of the journal to verify the correct order and names. For any
questions, please contact the editorial office of the journal or support@mdpi.com.
For LaTeX-related questions please contact latex@mdpi.com. 


\section{Introduction}

The introduction should briefly place the study in a broad context
and highlight why it is important. It should define the purpose of
the work and its significance. The current state of the research field
should be reviewed carefully and key publications cited. Please highlight
controversial and diverging hypotheses when necessary. Finally, briefly
mention the main aim of the work and highlight the principal conclusions.
As far as possible, please keep the introduction comprehensible to
scientists outside your particular field of research. Citing a journal
paper \citep{ref-journal}. Now citing a book reference \citep{ref-book1,ref-book2}
or other reference types \citep{ref-unpublish,ref-communication,ref-proceeding}.
Please use the command \citep{ref-thesis,ref-url} for the following
MDPI journals, which use author--date citation: Administrative Sciences,
Arts, Econometrics, Economies, Genealogy, Histories, Humanities, IJFS,
Journal of Intelligence, Journalism and Media, JRFM, Languages, Laws,
Religions, Risks, Social Sciences. 

\section{Materials and Methods}

Materials and Methods should be described with sufficient details
to allow others to replicate and build on published results. Please
note that publication of your manuscript implicates that you must
make all materials, data, computer code, and protocols associated
with the publication available to readers. Please disclose at the
submission stage any restrictions on the availability of materials
or information. New methods and protocols should be described in detail
while well-established methods can be briefly described and appropriately
cited.

Research manuscripts reporting large datasets that are deposited in
a publicly avail-able database should specify where the data have
been deposited and provide the relevant accession numbers. If the
accession numbers have not yet been obtained at the time of submission,
please state that they will be provided during review. They must be
provided prior to publication.

Interventionary studies involving animals or humans, and other studies
require ethical approval must list the authority that provided approval
and the corresponding ethical approval code. 
\begin{quote}
This is an example of a quote. 
\end{quote}

\section{Results}

This section may be divided by subheadings. It should provide a concise
and precise description of the experimental results, their interpretation
as well as the experimental conclusions that can be drawn. 

\subsection{Subsection}

\subsubsection{Subsubsection}

Bulleted lists look like this: 
\begin{itemize}
\item First bullet;

\begin{enumerate}
\item First item; 
\item Second item; 
\item Third item.

\subsection{Figures, Tables and Schemes}

All figures and tables should be cited in the main text as Figure~\ref{fig1},
Table~\ref{tab1}, Table~\ref{tab2}, etc.

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=10.5cm]{Definitions/logo-mdpi} \caption{This is a figure. Schemes follow the same formatting. If there are
multiple panels, they should be listed as: (\textbf{a}) Description
of what is contained in the first panel. (\textbf{b}) Description
of what is contained in the second panel. Figures should be placed
in the main text near to the first time they are cited. A caption
on a single line should be centered.\protect\label{fig1}}

\subsection{Formatting of Mathematical Components}

This is the example 1 of equation: \begin{linenomath}
\begin{equation}
a=1,
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath}the text following an equation need not be a new
paragraph. Please punctuate equations as regular text. 

This is the example 2 of equation: 

\begin{adjustwidth}{-\extralength}{0cm}{}

\begin{equation}
a=b+c+d+e+f+g+h+i+j+k+l+m+n+o+p+q+r+s+t+u+v+w+x+y+z
\end{equation}


\end{adjustwidth}{}

Please punctuate equations as regular text. Theorem-type environments
(including propositions, lemmas, corollaries etc.) can be formatted
as follows:
\begin{Theorem}
Example text of a theorem.
\end{Theorem}

The text continues here. Proofs must be formatted as follows:
\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem 1]
 Text of the proof. Note that the phrase ``of Theorem 1'' is optional
if it is clear which theorem is being referred to.
\end{proof}
The text continues here.

\section{Discussion}

Authors should discuss the results and how they can be interpreted
from the perspective of previous studies and of the working hypotheses.
The findings and their implications should be discussed in the broadest
context possible. Future research directions may also be highlighted.

\section{Conclusions}

This section is not mandatory, but can be added to the manuscript
if the discussion is unusually long or complex.

\section{Patents}

This section is not mandatory, but may be added if there are patents
resulting from the work reported in this manuscript.

The appendix is an optional section that can contain details and data
supplemental to the main text---for example, explanations of experimental
details that would disrupt the flow of the main text but nonetheless
remain crucial to understanding and reproducing the research shown;
figures of replicates for experiments of which representative data
are shown in the main text can be added here if brief, or as Supplementary
Data. Mathematical proofs of results not central to the paper can
be added as an appendix.
